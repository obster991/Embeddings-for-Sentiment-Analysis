University project at the course of Data Mining Technology for Business and Society concerning methods baseline or more advance for deal with text classification (NLP task) for Sentiment Analysis

# Project tasks

The homework is organized in two different part:

1. given the dataset organized as list of reviews, containing the text and the sentiment of the review; 1 represents a positive review, while 0 represents a negative review, we will perform a tf-idf encoding of the data, and then train a classifier, optimising its hyper-parameters. Also we will compare the result with a pipeline of  One-Hot-Encoding and PCA on the data, followed by a tuned KNeighborsClassifier.

2. given the same dataset, we will use pre-trained sentence embedding choosen in the "sentence-transformers" libraries and perform the best hyper-parameter optimisation we can afford in LESS than 10 minutes
